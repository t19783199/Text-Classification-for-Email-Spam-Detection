ML Self Project on : Text Classification for Email Spam Detection

# Email Spam Detection

A machine learning model for text classification to detect email spam.

## Overview

This project implements and compares different text vectorization techniques and classification models for email spam detection using a Kaggle dataset.

## Features

- Text vectorization: TF-IDF, GloVe, Word2Vec, BERT
- Sentence and word embeddings using BERT via Hugging Face
- Classification models: Feed-Forward Neural Network and XGBoost

## Technologies

- Python
- BERT
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn

## Results

- Feed-Forward Neural Network: 99% accuracy
- XGBoost classifier: 98% accuracy
